# Thai Game - Main Gameplay Path Review

## Game Flow Overview

### 1. Game Start
- **User Form**: Player enters name or skips to become "Guest"
- **Initial State**: All levels start at 0% progress
- **First Level**: Beginner level is unlocked by default

### 2. Level Progression System
- **Beginner Level**: Must complete 5 sentences correctly to unlock Intermediate
- **Intermediate Level**: Must complete 5 sentences correctly to unlock Advanced  
- **Advanced Level**: Final level - completing 5 sentences ends the game

### 3. Sentence Completion
- **Per Sentence**: Player drags Thai words to form correct sentence
- **Correct Answer**: Progress increases by 1 correct word
- **Incorrect Answer**: Incorrect word count increases, sentence retry allowed
- **Level Complete**: Exactly 5 correct sentences required

### 4. Level Transition
- **Automatic Progression**: When 5 sentences completed, automatically moves to next level
- **Progress Persistence**: All progress saved to localStorage
- **Leaderboard Submission**: Score submitted when level completed

## Issues Fixed

### ❌ **Ambiguous Stat Changes (FIXED)**

**Problem**: Progress was being updated in multiple places causing inconsistent state:
- `App.tsx` handleLevelComplete function
- `GameBoard.tsx` handleAnswerCheck function  
- Multiple useEffect hooks recalculating progress
- Debug button allowing artificial level completion

**Solution**: 
- ✅ Single source of truth for progress updates
- ✅ Removed redundant progress calculations
- ✅ Eliminated debug button from production
- ✅ Simplified progress update logic

### ❌ **Race Conditions (FIXED)**

**Problem**: Multiple async operations updating progress simultaneously

**Solution**:
- ✅ Single progress update per correct answer
- ✅ Immediate UI recalculation after progress change
- ✅ Removed redundant verification steps

### ❌ **Inconsistent State Management (FIXED)**

**Problem**: Progress state could become out of sync between localStorage and React state

**Solution**:
- ✅ Single `calculateProgress()` function called when needed
- ✅ Consistent data validation in userService
- ✅ Clear separation between local state and persistent storage

## Current Clean Gameplay Path

### 1. **Beginner Level (0-5 sentences)**
```
Start → Complete 5 sentences → Auto-progress to Intermediate
```

### 2. **Intermediate Level (0-5 sentences)**  
```
Start → Complete 5 sentences → Auto-progress to Advanced
```

### 3. **Advanced Level (0-5 sentences)**
```
Start → Complete 5 sentences → Game Complete → Leaderboard
```

## Progress Tracking (Now Unambiguous)

### Correct Words Counter
- **Increment**: Only when sentence is correctly completed
- **Max Value**: Exactly 5 per level
- **Reset**: Only when starting new game

### Incorrect Words Counter  
- **Increment**: Only when sentence is incorrectly completed
- **Persistent**: Carries over within level
- **Reset**: Only when starting new game

### Time Tracking
- **Start**: When level begins
- **End**: When level completes (5 correct sentences)
- **Submission**: To leaderboard with final stats

## Data Flow (Simplified)

```
User Action → GameBoard → userService.updateProgress() → calculateProgress() → UI Update
```

**Single Update Path**: No more ambiguous multiple update points

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Complete Beginner Level**: Verify exactly 5 sentences required
2. **Auto-progression**: Verify automatic move to Intermediate
3. **Progress Persistence**: Verify progress saved after browser refresh
4. **Level Locking**: Verify higher levels remain locked until prerequisites met
5. **Game Completion**: Verify final completion message and leaderboard

## Files Modified

- `src/App.tsx`: Simplified progress calculation and removed debug button
- `src/components/GameBoard/GameBoard.tsx`: Streamlined progress updates
- `src/services/userService.ts`: Improved validation and logging
- `GAMEPLAY_PATH_REVIEW.md`: This documentation

The gameplay path is now clean, unambiguous, and follows a clear progression system with consistent stat tracking.
